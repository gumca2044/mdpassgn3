  <h2>GMC Sierra</h2>
  <p>
  Astoundingly advanced and exceedingly premium, the 2023 GMC Sierra 1500 is designed for pickup excellence. A tall, confident stance with a 2" factory-installed lift, mud-terrain tires, Red Recovery Hooks and dark, distinguished details create a look that’s as bold as Sierra 1500 AT4’s road capability. Paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission and delivering 420 horsepower and 460 lb.-ft. of torque, this engine has the serious power you need for big jobs or big fun.
